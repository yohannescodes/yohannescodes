## How to update
- Fill `PR/Branch` with branch name and PR URL once opened.
- In `Artifacts`, link to stored files (outline, draft, Lighthouse, schema JSON, internal link map) under `/artifacts/portfolio/` or `/artifacts/blog/`.
- Add dates or version notes inline when moving from Drafting → In review → Published → Promoted.
- Use the Notes section for blockers, schema validation results, and indexing requests with timestamps.

## Notes
- Request indexing in Search Console immediately after publish and note the timestamp.
- Promotion targets: LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, iOS/Swift communities (e.g., iOS Dev Weekly submissions), and cross-links from relevant portfolio pages.
- After 30 days, add impressions/clicks/avg position deltas for the target keyword in a brief note.
