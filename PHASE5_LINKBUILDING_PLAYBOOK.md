# Phase 5 Execution Playbook: Link Building & Digital PR (Weeks 4–12)

Use this playbook to earn authoritative links and mentions that reinforce "Yohannes Haile" as an iOS engineer in Ethiopia. Applies to **yohannescodes.com** and **yohanenswrites.com**.

## Workflow & Branching
- **Branching**: one branch per outreach/asset set (e.g., `seo/p5-guest-post-ios-dev-weekly`, `seo/p5-directory-submissions`, `seo/p5-press-case-study`).
- **Artifacts per PR**: outreach email templates, published URLs/screenshots, anchor text mapping, UTM-tagged links, and backlink audit CSV (before/after).
- **Storage**: save under `/artifacts/portfolio/` or `/artifacts/blog/` as `phase5-backlinks-before.csv`, `phase5-guest-post-emails.md`, `phase5-press-screenshots.png`.
- **Tracker**: log targets, status, PRs, and links in `phase5-tracker.md`.

## Core Channels & Tactics
- **Developer backlinks**: guest posts or tutorials for iOS newsletters (e.g., iOS Dev Weekly), Swift forums, or OSS maintainers; include contextual anchor text ("Yohannes Haile iOS engineer") to portfolio/blog.
- **Swift packages**: enhance README/AUTHORS/Docs for ClarioKit and other packages with backlinks; add badges linking to portfolio and blog tutorials.
- **Case-study PR**: pitch notable app/package launches to mobile dev podcasts/blogs; publish a press page on the portfolio and link it internally.
- **Directories**: submit to Indie Hackers, Product Hunt maker profile, BetaList, and relevant Ethiopian tech directories with consistent NAP.
- **Local/community**: sponsor or mentor at local meetups; publish recap posts with internal links and embedded media.
- **Broken-link & unlinked mention**: monitor mentions and convert them into links; offer replacement resources for broken iOS links.

## Implementation Details
- Maintain a **target list** with priority, contact info, and pitch angle; log in tracker.
- Use **UTM parameters** on outreach links to measure referral performance.
- Ensure **anchor text diversity**: mix name + profession, brand, and topical anchors (SwiftUI tutorial, Swift package).
- Update **robots/sitemaps** if new pages (press page, resources) are added.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Backlink audit CSV shows net-new authoritative links with correct anchors.
- [ ] Directory submissions live with consistent NAP and portfolio/blog links.
- [ ] Guest posts or PR placements link to the right canonical URLs.
- [ ] Internal press/resources pages updated and included in sitemap.
- [ ] Tracker updated with publish dates, URLs, and metrics.

## Reporting
- Biweekly: summarize new links (domain, anchor, target URL), referral traffic, and any movement for name/location queries. Record in `phase5-tracker.md`.
